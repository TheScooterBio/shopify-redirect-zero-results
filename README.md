# Redirect Search Result Pages with Zero Results (Shopify)
When visitors search on your site and get zero results, it's not the best experience. You sometimes want to redirect to a more relevant page instead of just saying "sorry, there are no results". This page can be a similar result to what they searched for, a replacement or a substitute product.

This tutorial code will show you how to achieve this. It requires a little bit of copy and paste in your Shopify backend. To make it work, it should take about 5 minutes no more.

# Steps

1. Login to Shopify Backend
2. Create your search terms redirects CSV via this https://github.com/onescales/shopify-redirect-zero-results/blob/main/Shopify-Search-Redirects.csv (one row for terms and one row for full url to redirect to) - here you will be placing your terms and where to redirect to.
3. Complete CSV with terms and redirects. Save as CSV & Upload to files via Content
4. Copy the code template from https://github.com/onescales/shopify-redirect-zero-results/blob/main/searchresults.liquid
5. Add code to your theme. Click on Online Store -> Themes -> Customize your theme. Edit your search.liquid page and at top of page, paste the code. *Make sure to change row 8 "FULL-URL-HERE" with the full url of your file from above step 3.
6. Start Using It. Enjoy!
